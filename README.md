**Steps followed when building a DIY-SOLAR-PHONE-CHARGER**	
	
Step 1 - Drawing

Step 2 - Tool Box/ Tool Kit
         Open the kit and get the tools and materials to use

Step 3 - Tools and materials 
* Identify the tools and materials 
* Arrange the materials and the tools

Step 4 - Test the following materials 
         * The total voltage of the solar panel 
         * The LED light using the LED tester

Step 5 - Calculations 
         Calculate the Resistance
	 
Step 6 - Bread board 
         Get the bread board and place it at the helping hand
	 
Step 7 - Fix the following materials 
         * Fix a positive (+wire red in color) and negative (-wire black in color) for input source (power) 
	 
         * Fix the diode 
	 
         * Fix a positive wire from the input source (+wire) to the diode 
	 
         * Fix the resistors in positive side of the diode and have to be in series for easy calculation
	 
Step 8 - Resistor 
         Fix the resistors in positive side of the diode and have to be in series for easy calculation
	 
Step 9 - LED light 
         Fix the LED light to positive side of the resistors
	 
Step 10 - Regulator 
         Fix the regulator where the black side need to face your side
	 
Step 11 - Small Capacitor 
         Fix the small capacitor
	 
Step 12 - Big capacitor 
         Fix the big capacitor
	 
Step 13 - Regulator and diode 
          Connect the left pin of the regulator to the diode and resistors
	 
Step 14 - capacitor, diode, resistor and regulator 
          Connect the positive pin of the first capacitor to the join the diode, resistors and the left pin of the regulator
	  
Step 15 - Regulator and big capacitor 
          Connect the right pin of the regulator to the positive pin of the big capacitor
	  
Step 16 - Regulator and LED 
          Connect the middle pin of the regulator to the negative pin of the LED light
	  
Step 17 - Small capacitor to the LED 
          Connect the negative pin of the small capacitor to negative pin of the LED light
	  
Step 18 - Big capacitor and LED 
          Connect the negative pin of the big capacitor to negative pin of the LED light
	  
Step 19 - All negative sides 
          In all connect the negative sides together
	  
Step 20 - Positive wire 
          Fix +wire to the positive pin of the big capacitor
	  
Step 21 - Negative 
          Fix –wire to the negative pin of the big capacitor
	  
Step 22 - Female USB 
          Connect the female USB to the +wire and –wire on the capacitor
	  
Step 23 – Test
          Test the solar charger in the sun and test the output and charge the phone
